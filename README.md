# GFYM

GFYM is an exercise to translate a popular phrase into many languages.

Please add translations for your favorite language to the list and send a PR to spread the love.

If using a language that doesn't use romanized characters (kanji, cyrillic, devenagari, etc), feel free to add the response in those characters, as well as your name/email/nom-de-plume. PRs must more or less match a Google Translate to be included. 


formatting example:
phrase, language notes, contributor notes

e.g.
```
- иди трахни свою мать, Russian (via google translate), Eponymous gfym@suckerpun.ch
```
